    anything <10% makes the titleline go up - so, overlap with the first row.
    basically only mobiles in portrait have a non-overlapping titleline.
    for any other screen (even mobile in landscape) there's overlap.
    this is to save space because the boxes arrangement is 2x2, taking up a lot of height.
